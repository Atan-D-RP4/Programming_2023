    Okay, it's way too late and I have to sleep so I'll write this log tomorrow morning. This better not become a habit for me. Again.

    Hola~! Good morning to myself from the past. But as you can see on the timestamp, it's already very late so this log ain't gonna get finished
    now. I'll write as much of it as I can now and the rest... I'll figure it out. I have ideas. But this will be done today.

    I woke up at basically 8:00AM. Went through my morning routine, showered after Mom let me have the bathroom, etc..,. I sat down and watced a 
    bunch of YouTube. Mom asked if I was open to driving off in Srikakulam and I told her I was game.

    The problem though was that Dad woke up pretty late and didn't have enough time to cook anything this morning before he had to hit his early 
    morning shift that he got assigned for this Sunday.

    So, of course, she wakes Praneeth up to take him. If you don't trust me to do something, don't ask about it in the first place you damn HAG.

    I helped out in the kitchen and did some other chores Mom tasked me for an hour.

    Getting back to this log much later than when I wanted to do this. But I can't change the past so let's just deal with it.

    So, okay where was I? Right Mom and Praneeth left sometime after that. Dad dropped by to unlock the door for them. I ate the dal we cooked for 
    lunch. It was pretty bland since there was no curry, but I did not say anything since it would never amount to much.

    I watched a ton of YouTube shorts and videos. Found out there exists an Odin programming language that is mainly for web dev, I think, that is 
    completely separate from the Odin Project which looked like a web-dev courses and training platform.

    Spent a couple hours consuming pleasure stimulating video content on the Internet. I need to stop doing it and find a fucking therapist.
