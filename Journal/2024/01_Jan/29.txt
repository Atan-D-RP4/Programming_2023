    Today was better than most days at home. It had a bit of everything.

    I woke up around 9:00AM as usual. There is finally honey in the house. I ate that. Drank my coffee hot. And 
    proceeded to spend most of the morning on more Minimalist C projects. 

    The water heater was not working properly so I showered with cold water. I am proud to say I took it like a
    MAN! Ate some of Mom's Oats for breakfast. She never finishes that. 

    Looked at other YouTube stuff in between. Mom and Praneeth went out today for more work on the houses. Mom
    had a big row with Dileep. There were threats of humiliation and such. Ultimately it boiled down to him wanting
    to leave our service before his term is up and with a raise, as I understand it at least.

    Moving on, I ate a late lunch of the Cauliflower curry that I lamented not being able to eat last night. Watched
    another episode of the 7th Time Loop anime. 

    Started writing the Unit-2 part of the DMS assignment. Finished it in the late evening 8:40PM or something. Took 
    a break in between to eat, drink evening coffee, eating again and some other interruptions. The break also 
    involved giving in to my urges for fantasy.

    Played a bunch of Roblox after I finished that part of the assginment. Some chess. Praneeth finally came home and 
    joined Mom and Dad in their Panchayat like a good Eldest Son.

    I spent the rest of the evening trying to make a GUI application work with X11 display to no avail. At least I 
    enjoyed the leftover Fried Rice and curry Mom that brought home.

    That's it. More succinct than I imagined but I have to get to sleep now. It's already very late and I have to get
    to college tomorrow.
