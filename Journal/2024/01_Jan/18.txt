    I really should be going to sleep. But it's fine since I woke up very late at around
     8:30AM or thereabouts. Mom and Dad were the same.

    I showered right after Dad. Spent the morning watching YouTube, playing Hades, and 
    helping out with chores around the house. Stuff like that. Was bored so scrolled Insta 
    for a while too.

    Reached out to classmate for some assignment work. Didn't get a helpful reply. Am I really
    that unlikeable or something?

    Decided that I wanted to do some coding and thought I should finish getting that Gold badge
    on Hackerrank for C. So I got on that, and spent most the rest of the day on it.

    I helped out a bunch in the kitchen again. Onion chopping is eye-watering. And ate dinner 
    watching YouTube. Did some more work on Hackerrank problems.

    Managed 10 push-ups today. Though I felt them a lot in my shoulders when it's supposed to 
    actually hit the core. So I don't think I did them properly.

    I really enjoyed my food this whole day. As well as last night. Capsicum-Paneer curry, some very 
    well made Dal, Bottle Gourd curry and a Potatoe-Mealmaker curry. Everything was delicious. And I was
    quick enough to get good pickings of all of them.

    It's surprising how little has happend today. 

    Praneeth actually showered today and went to the Gym too. Mom is very stressed, preparing and pooja 
    event for the house in Srikakulam and the interior planning for the one in Yendada.

    I need to really start preparing for my exams. I have to do well in the Sem exams if don't want tank
    my GPA. I should to turn in any pending assignments as well.

    Other things on the list of things I should get done is something about my license. As well as getting 
    a PAN card and a Voter card and have my other SIM card fixed.  

    That's it for this log. I'm going to sleep.
