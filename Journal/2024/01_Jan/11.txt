    Alright, as the timestamp above suggests, I'm writing this very late so the 
    account is going to be quite sparse as my memory of the day has faded out.

    I'm pretty sure I had a semi-frantic morning.

    Washing the boiled eggs down has not been easy these days considering how long
    I spend in the bathroom.

    I don't know what I did over the bus ride. I think I spent it reading a new fic 
    update and just going through some forum websites.

    I did not prepare any for my DC or DMS exams. Both of which I did not write well 
    by any measure.

    I pretty sure I had lunch in the cafetria. I don't properly remember.

    When I got back home, Mom asked if had eaten anything and I said I hadn't. She asked 
    me what I wanted to eat and I asked her make some Upma.

    By the time I finished showering, she had made Upma. Even though she's been 
    complaining that her leg has been terrible and that she's got so much work.

    I asked her to make me Upma to eat. And she did.

    I am so goddamn lucky to have that. Regardless of how much I may fight her or 
    resent or how our relationship devolves, I will have that. And I am so grateful 
    for it.

    In the evening, when I went over to the main bedroom to just lie down for a while,
    I didn't wake up at all, missed dinner, and the day finished right there.

    When I woke up, it was actually the fucking morning.
