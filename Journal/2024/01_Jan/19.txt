    Ah, I hate the way I spent the day. My anxiety for the upcoming Sem exams is
    building. But first, let's see about the rest of the poorly spent day.

    I woke up at 9:00AM, cleaned up and showered after Dad and Mom. Drank my coffee,
    forgot to have any breakfast, even though we had eggs. Still don't have any honey
    in the house.

    Spent a the morning checking for updates, some YouTube, Percy Jackson stuff. Then 
    I started to work on those Hackerrank problems. 

    Then I helped cook lunch. Ate lunch, got a shiny Gold Badge on Hackerrank for C.

    Then I started on another problem that would be the bane of my existence. The rest
    of the day I spent trying to make the program work, between more old fanfics, YouTube,
    helping cook dinner, and eating dinner.

    I only managed five push-ups today just before dinner. I did feel them more in my torso
    this time around.

    My type speed is now a consistent 50 words per minute.

    I didn't get a chance to watch the new episode of My Demon that released today.

    Got Praneeth to buy me a game on discount that's been in my cart for a week. I'm going to 
    make hold him to his word about paying for a new set of earpods for me. I'm still salty 
    about how he refused to bring back my other pair.
    
    As I mentioned, the exams are approaching. I'm not worried about the first one which Is 
    DSAC, but the second is CO. And I haven't done any of the stuff I need to do for DMS.

    Ah the anxiety is starting to hit. I need to sleep it off. Good night.
