    Good Morning to me!

    I arose from my slumber today at 7:00AM and got up to shower at 7:30AM, having
    not brushed my teeth.

    I just remembered that I haven't eaten any honey yet today. After I already had 
    coffee. This shall be rectified immediately.

    I helped with a couple chores in the kitchen and did some YouTubing, and here I am.

    I've been putting this off, but I'm going to finish it now.

    This day followed the same pattern as the day before.

    I spent most of the day revisiting the Percy Jackson fandom though. I definitely 
    enjoyed that.

    Apart from that and a nice conversation with Dad in English, the details of which are
    now lost to me, there's nothing much to write about.

    fin.
