    Good morning! Let's get right into it.

    I woke up at 7:00AM sharp. Brushed my teeth and put the milk and a couple of eggs on the 
    stove over weak flames.

    Then I wrote up my log for yesterday that I was too late with last night. In the middle of 
    I checked on the milk and the eggs, the milk was done so I poured myself some coffee and oiled
    my hair while I waited for the eggs.

    I dallied a bunch with un-shelling and eating the eggs, until it was like 9:00AM or something.

    Most of the day was spent watching YouTube as usual and, today, with playing a bunch of Hacknet.
    Helping in the kitchen was somewhat involved too. I also dived into the BBC Merlin fandom of fics.

    For lunch, Dad I finished the leftover Panner curry from yesterday alongside the Dal. For dinner,
    we made a curry out of the Potatoes I diced.

    I finished Assignment-2 for DMS, but I haven't even started on the 'All Definitions' that I should
    actually have finished by now. I hate myself. I need therapy.

    Mom and Praneeth came back sometime around 10:00PM or something. I don't remember exactly, a whole 
    day after the fact.

    Oh, did I mention I procrastinated on writing this day's log as well. Yeah, I'm writing it on the 
    evening of the day after it should be done. *sigh of self-disappointment*

    I stayed up deep into the night reading a Merlin fanfic. I couldn't sleep since I caught I pretty 
    strong nap in the afternoon. Completely forgot I did that.

    Anyway, that's as much detail I can squeeze out about the day so I'll leave it here. Anything else I
    remember will show up on later commits.

    fin.
