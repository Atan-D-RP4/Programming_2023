    This is very late. But I'm not going to put if off anymore or it will never get done at all.

    Waking up this day was... a terrifying because I did at 8:00AM and thought I still had an exam to write. It was
    such a relief to know that I'd forgotten that today was a holiday on account of Jagan and the exam was postponed.

    I went back to sleep. Woke up again at 9:00AM, had nothing for breakfast except coffee and skipped showering.

    I built a bunch of Minimalist C projects over the course of the day. Attempted to figure out SSHing into a AWS 
    server, did not work out that. Solved a LeetCode problem, a Hackerrank Python problem, made sure I included error
    checking in those C projects I was working on and ensured they actually worked.

    Read a 'The Boys' - 'Percy Jackson' in the afternoon. Spent a while on YouTube and forums, played a bit of chess in
    the late afternoon and did not do well at it. Read the previous days unread newsletters. Read the new chapter of 'My
    Hero Academia'.

    Tried to get style50 and debug50 to work on my personal codespace to no avail.

    I did not manage any exercise this day. Zero, zip, nada. No progress on the assignment I still haven't finished and no
    studying for the exam.

    I made sure to go to bed early at least at 11:30PM considering I had an exam the next day.

    That's about everything of note I can remember in regards to this day.
