    I woke up at 6:30AM. Woke Mom up, cause it's Sankranti and went to back sleep
    to sleep on the soft bed cause the futon with Dad did not do it for me.

    I woke up again at 8:30AM and showered and other stuff. It's the festival day so
    we did some stuff for that and then I had breakfast.

    I am currently whiling away my time when I really should be studying for my Sem
    exams. Which feels pointless cause no matter what, my GPA this Sem is going to be 
    dogshit.

    I finished all the lectures for CS50. I have to do submit50 on all of my problem sets
    again since it's 2024 now, but I just that and the progress will carry over.

    I... did not do any studying for Sem exams today either. On the plus side I managed to 
    do seven push ups in a row.

    Got into a new C-drama. Napped for a couple hours in the afternoon some Youtube shorts, 
    okay a lot of shorts and stuff.

    And what else? Had a masala Dosa for dinner since the folk went out to visit more temples
    and do some shopping again.

    Anyway that's my day for today. I have to go to bed or be skined by Mom so...
