    Today was... something. Let's get into it. See what I can call it at the end of this.

    I woke up at around 9:15AM, brushed my teeth, drank my coffee, mourned the lack of honey in my diet,
    and sat down to wile away the day.

    Also my sleep last night was weird as all hell. I woke up intermittently, twice. And I had a bunch of odd
    dreams that I knew were dreams like daydreams, and I remember half-consciously chuckling about them in 
    real-life lying on the bed like I sometimes do when I'm normally daydreaming. Very weird.

    I started watching YouTube for a while, checking for updates on things I keep track of. Then an hour 
    or so in and I start playing Hacknet. I didn't stop until I finished the game sometime in the afternoon.

    Mom came over in the middle of her supervision of the servants doing housework to hadn me some of her 
    oats for breakfast. I feasted on that, which I usually deny but I was a little desperate.

    In the middle I went over to the kitchen to help cook lunch. I ate whilst I was playing the game. 

    Finally showered around like 4:30PM or something since I skipped doing it in the morning. Played some 
    TypeRacer. I'm amost hitting 50WPM consistently, and 65WPM being my top speed. Will work to improve it.

    I continued to wile the time away with YouTube and fanfics until I finally got tired of that and picked 
    myself up for studying. I finished one unit of CO out the 5 on syllabus for us. Reeeal assuring that.

    Anyway I accepted that I was gonna be screwed for tomorrow's exam and went to over to the kitchen to help
    out with making dinner. That took a minute and involved lots of dicing ingredients and tears in my eyes, 
    beacause onions.

    I ate dinner passing time. Continued doing so afterwards. And am now writing this log. 

    I did mess around with .json files in my cs50 codespaces just to see if I can mess with the thing. Didn't 
    really do anything, that.

    Now I'm off to bed since I'm late enough for that as it is and I still have to wake up pretty early to get 
    to college.
