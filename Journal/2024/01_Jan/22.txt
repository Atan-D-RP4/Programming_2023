    I'm writing this a day late. SO it's going to be sparse on the details.

    I woke up late enough that I decided to forgo showering right away like I usually do and just had 
    brushed my teeth and had my coffee and then got on with the day. No breakfast, since I forgot about 
    the eggs.

    Managed to study a little for the DS exam in the morning while eating lunch.
    
    Played Hacknet for a while, just a couple missions. 

    I went out for a haircut today, was not massively happy with the results but, eh, whatever. I came back
    home, showered finally, and got back to browsing.

    YouTube, forums, manga, chess, fanfics, for a couple hours and then I finally hit the books at around 
    8:40PM.
    
    I finished one-fifth of the third DMS assignment, i.e., the part for the first unit. Only took, like,
    an hour and a half. 

    Helped with cooking dinner, ate, more wasting of time, followed by an early retiring to bed, so that I 
    could get up early tomorrow morning.
