    Alright, I'm going to finish this and then head of to sleep.

    Today, sucked. Getting out of bed today was a chore. The clock in the hall
    is behind on time. Luckily I still woke up at 6:00AM.

    I think I got up twice in the night for something. I'm not sure what it was.

    Anyway, I cleaned up, washed down some boiled eggs with my coffee and set off
    to the bus stop.

    I managed some study but wound up just scorlling Insta, forums, browsing fic 
    updates, losing myself in my music and naps. You know, the usual.

    Did some studying before the exam, bombed the exam and started to mentally 
    prepare for doing the same for the one I have to write in the afternoon.

    I really need to go to sleep so I'll finish the rest of this later.
