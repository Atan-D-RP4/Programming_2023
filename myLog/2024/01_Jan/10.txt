    Alright, I'm going to finish this and then head of to sleep.

    Today, sucked. Getting out of bed today was a chore. The clock in the hall
    is behind on time. Luckily I still woke up at 6:00AM.

    I think I got up twice in the night for something. I'm not sure what it was.

    Anyway, I cleaned up, washed down some boiled eggs with my coffee and set off
    to the bus stop.

    I managed some study but wound up just scorlling Insta, forums, browsing fic 
    updates, losing myself in my music and naps. You know, the usual.

    Did some studying before the exam, bombed the exam and started to mentally 
    prepare for doing the same for the one I have to write in the afternoon.

    I really need to go to sleep so I'll finish the rest of this later.

    Alright, this is pretty late but I'm going to do my best to remember the events
    of the day to write this out.

    I left a bit of lunch unfinished, even though I liked it. And did some preparation
    for the afternoon exam. Bombed it.

    Got to see my DS paper corrected by Lokeswari Mam. Both mine and Harsith's, Mam did 
    in front of us along with a couple others. Both of us did pretty well.
 
    It was quite fortunate, as we'd just went to meet Mam for Harsith to ask some innane
    question about his paper. 

    Anyway, I don't remember what I did on the bus, but it most likely involved music and
    sleep at some point so it's the same as usual.

    I think I got in with my key when I came home. But I don't remember.

    I did not do any studying for the other two theory heavy exams tomorrow. Though I did 
    finished watching Before Sunset. Or was it Before Midnight? One of the two. 

    And then I went to sleep.
