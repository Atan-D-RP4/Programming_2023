    I like driving. Not a a very descriptive or explainative way to start the log.

    But that's fine. Today mostly sucks.

    I woke up at 7:00AM but made the mistake of staying on the bed until 8:30AM.

    I've spent the entire rest of the day with a fully uncomfortable torso. It's not
    even pain, but a fundamental discomfort,...

    All the folks just went out right now for doing some shopping and visiting of 
    temples. I stayed home because, at present moment I really was not in the mood for
    doing anything.

    And Praneeth was going so I wouldn't get to drive so there was no point in me going.

    I had to go to the latrine a second time today when I really should not have needed 
    it. Mom and Dad says it's Gastric discomfort or something along those lines but I 
    don't know. Felt more like something to do with the muscles and lungs.

    I spent most of the watching YouTube. I did do some programming too. Think I have a
    solution for both of the Tutorial Questions for DS. They were on LeetCode. So I had 
    free testing for them.

    I'm going through the manga for Hell's Paradise at the moment. Since there are no 
    updates for any of the things I read. Shonen Jump is on break after all.

    Okay I'm quickly going to go work on yesterday's log which I left unfinished. I'll 
    probably come to this before I go to sleep. I will definitely not procrastinate on
    it this time. And I really have to start preparing for my Sem exams.
