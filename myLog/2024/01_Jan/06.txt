    Today, went better than expected all things considered.

    I got myself up and out of bed at 6:00AM as usual. I really can't get myself
    off the bed before that with how cold the winter mornings are these days.

    I went straight into the shower today, cause Nature called very strongly today.

    'Then' I went about my morning routine. No eggs today because Saturday. There 
    was, in its place butter-roasted bread! Which I haven't had in a while.

    I ate my unusual breakfirst to the new episode of My Demon which I couldn't 
    finish last night.

    I won another game of chess on the bus and then I fell asleep.
