    Alright, I'm writing this post-mortem or whatever because, honestly, yesterday
    sucked. And I mean sucked.

    I did not wake up as early as I wanted to. Had trouble eating my boiled eggs.
    Was almost late because of it.

    I spent the bus ride helping Bhaskar with his DTPI project website and setting 
    up a server for it instead of preparing for my own Internal Lab exam.

    The morning Session was pretty tame. Ratnam(Java) allowed us to prepare for the 
    exam and so did Lokeswari Mam after her. Spandana Mam and Gayatri Mam lectured for
    their classes. Which was not very terrible at all.

    I attacked my lunch and wound it up at 12:40, went up and down twice to get Mam's
    Computer to the Lab and a Projector.

    We started the Internal, and I got the question that was going to be the most 
    bothersome for me. Whereas Harsith got easy shit.

    Another thing is that my stomach acted up in the middle of it. It was so badcd that I
    had to a toilet break to execrete. Today, of all days!

    My program kept crashing because of recursive function not assigning memory
    properly cause some logic that was inside a conditional was outside it.

    So I probably failed that part. I did likely score perfectly for viva though.

    The bus ride home was just normal. I continue to sneeze red out of my left nostril,
    which is scary but will hopefully pass. My dump had mucous mixed in and very 
    uncomfortable to drop.
