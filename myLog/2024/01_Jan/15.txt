    I woke up at 6:30AM. Woke Mom up, cause it's Sankranti and went to back sleep
    to sleep on the soft bed cause the futon with Dad did not do it for me.

    I woke up again at 8:30AM and showered and other stuff. It's the festival day so
    we did some stuff for that and then I had breakfast.

    I am currently whiling away my time when I really should be studying for my Sem
    exams. Which feels pointless cause no matter what, my GPA this Sem is going to be 
    dogshit.
