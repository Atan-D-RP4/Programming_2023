HelloooOO, 2024!!!!

I have officially moved off of OneNote to Github Plain Text for my Logs.
I'll figure out structure and format as I go on from here.

Getting to today:
    It is Mon Jan  1 15:52:05 UTC 2024 as I write this.
    I woke up pretty late today and did not have eggs for breakfast.
    Nor did I do any exercise or eat any apples(don't even have any in the house).
    I want to do my best for the rest of the year to do these things everyday.
    Another thing I haven't done is physically indulged in myself, 
    as I have been doing for the past week. 
    This time, I'm gonna try to keep the streak alive for the whole month 
    again and the one after it for good measure.
    I finished up my DS record, which is ready to be handed in.
    I still have a Java Assignment, that is due tomorrow, to write so I'll get on that.
    Oh, not to mention the DTPI sheets/report thing, for the Evening Session tomorrow.
    I wished a bunch of relatives a Happy New Year as they called Mom to do the same.
    Found out that the Week 10 Lecture on CS50 is really just a recap and a 
    Seminar on the Emoji character-set in Unicode and how it evolved.
    So nothing new to 'Learn' per se, but interesting stuff.
