HelloooOO, 2024!!!!

I have officially moved off of OneNote to Github Plain Text for my Logs.
I'll figure out structure and format as I go on from here.

Getting to today:

        It is Mon Jan  1 15:52:05 UTC 2024 as I write this.
        I woke up pretty late today and did not have eggs for breakfast.
        Nor did I do any exercise or eat any apples(don't even have any in the house).
        I want to do my best for the rest of the year to do these things everyday.
        Another thing I haven't done is physically indulged in myself, 
        as I have been doing for the past week. 
        This time, I'm gonna try to keep the streak alive for the whole month 
        again and the one after it for good measure.
        I finished up my DS record, which is ready to be handed in.
        I still have a Java Assignment, that is due tomorrow, to write so I'll get on that.
        Oh, not to mention the DTPI sheets/report thing, for the Evening Session tomorrow.
        I wished a bunch of relatives a Happy New Year as they called Mom to do the same.
        Found out that the Week 10 Lecture on CS50 is really just a recap and a 
        Seminar on the Emoji character-set in Unicode and how it evolved.
        So nothing new to 'Learn' per se, but interesting stuff.

        Since it's New Year and all, I thought I would create a New Repository for all of 
        that year's files, so I did.
        I playes around with some git to make it so that I can pull files from this on demand 
        on that other repository. Found it too annoying to deal with and scrapped the whole idea.
        I'll just continue with this repo with adjusted desciptions and stuff.
        The Logs/Journal I can move to another when it deserves it, which will take years so
        that can left alone pretty much.
